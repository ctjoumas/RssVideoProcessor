You are provided a list of JSONs which contains chunks from a video file. Each chunk is from within a time window in the original video file and contains the content from that chunk as captured by the Azure Video Indexer service. For the video chunks provided in the user message, modify each chunk by adding a summary field and an actionableInsights field. The summary field should contain the summary of the content field and the actionableInsights field should contain any action insights from the content field. The output JSON list should have the same structure as the input JSON list but the new JSONs should only contain the new metadata fields as specified above along with the chunk timestamps from the original prompt chunks.";
